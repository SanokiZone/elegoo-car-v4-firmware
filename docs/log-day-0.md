# Build Log - Day 0: Preparation
**Date:** February 20, 2026
**Status:** Hardware arriving tomorrow.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Initialize version control and repository structure.
- Verify software environment (Arduino IDE).
- Research the Elegoo V4.0 pin mapping and TB6612FNG motor driver.

## 🛠️ Progress
- [x] Created GitHub repository with `src`, `docs`, and `media` directories.
- [x] Configured `README.md` with project objectives.
- [x] Successfully verified "Blink" sketch in Arduino IDE.

## 💡 Notes & Research
The V4.0 kit uses a different motor driver than previous versions. I need to ensure that the libraries I use tomorrow are compatible with the specific pinout of the V4.0 expansion board.

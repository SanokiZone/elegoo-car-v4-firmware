# Build Log - Day 1: Mechanical Assembly
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Status:** Hardware Build Complete

## 🛠️ Actions Taken
- [x] Completed full mechanical assembly of the Elegoo V4.0 chassis.
- [x] Verified motor polarities and cable management.
- [x] Performed initial power-on test and battery calibration.
- [x] Tested factory firmware via the mobile app (Remote Control & Camera).

## 💡 Engineering Observations
- **Chassis Alignment:** Ensuring the "A" side faced upward was critical for sensor mounting.
- **Wiring:** The TB6612FNG driver requires careful cable routing to avoid interference with the ultrasonic servo.

## 🎯 Next Objective
- Wipe the factory firmware and upload custom "Manual Override" code to understand the motor logic.
